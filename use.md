## Desk

I got an [UPLIFT Desk](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) about a year ago, and it's completely changed how I use work at my desk. Before, I had an [IKEA TROTTEN](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/trotten-desk-sit-stand-white-s99429578/) crank standing desk, and while it was a good starter standing desk, I barely used the standing mode because of how cumbersome it was to use the crank. Now, I find myself trying to spend at least some time each day standing rather than just lounging in my chair.

## Hardware

I have a two-computer setup, one PC and one Mac. This was mostly due to the game development aspect of my career rather than the web development side. Doing game development on a Mac is fine until it isn't. Although, I did build most, if not all, of [Flip Jacks](https://flipjacksgame.com/) on my Mac. I have two monitors, one for each computer, so I can easily switch between them. I have a KVM switch for my keyboard, mouse, and microphone, although I don't use it unless I need to because I keep a separate keyboard and mouse for each computer.

### PC

My PC is a custom-built PC, my first, as I've been a Mac user my entire career.

### Mac

This is my first Mac desktop, and I love it. I've been a laptop Mac user since I got my first MacBook with a white plastic polycarbonate shell in the early 2000s.
