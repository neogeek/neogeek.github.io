title: Node.js Starter Kit
description: Lately I've been finding myself setting up what seems to be the same Node.js application over and over again. In an effort to mitigate some of the initial setup of these sometimes one-off projects I've released a very simple to use starter kit.
keywords: nodejs

Instructions for getting started can be found in the project's repo <https://github.com/neogeek/nodejs-starter-kit>.

Below is a video demonstration showing how easy it is to get up and running in only a couple of minutes.
