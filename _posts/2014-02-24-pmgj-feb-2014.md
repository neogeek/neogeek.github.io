title: Purple Monkey Game Jam Feb 2014
description: This past weekend I participated in the [Purple Monkey Game Jam](http://purplemonkeygamejam.com/), an event run and sponsored by [Cantina](http://cantina.co/) in downtown Boston, MA. The theme for this game jam was **"You win, ... now what."** Here is brief description of both the story and the functionality of my game.

A darker look into the world of Mario, [Super Mario Corpse](http://robotmonsterlovesyou.github.io/purplemonkeygamejam-feb-2014/) explores the thin separation between life, death, and destruction. Playing as a recently failed and supposedly deceased Mario, you attempt to make your way to the surface through a densely packed grave of those who have perished after you and other undead foes seeking you for revenge.

Game mechanics include:

- Resistance as you climb through corpses, displacing them along your path.
- Star power-up which temporally reduces resistance.
- Bullet Bill/Bob-Bomb power-up which explodes upon contact, displacing corpses in a radius around Mario or enemy.
- Enemies that zero in on your location.

Built with vanilla JavaScript, [jQuery Easing](https://github.com/ai/easings.net) for animating numbers with easing and [SAT.js](http://jriecken.github.io/sat-js/) for collision detection.
