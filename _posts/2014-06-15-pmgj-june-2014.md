title: Purple Monkey Game Jam June 2014
description: This past weekend I participated in the [Purple Monkey Game Jam](http://purplemonkeygamejam.com/), an event run and sponsored by [Cantina](http://cantina.co/) in downtown Boston, MA. The theme for this game jam was **"Light & Shadow"**. Here is brief description of both the story and the functionality of my game.

A nondescript character is lost in a dark forest filled with other unknown creatures. These creatures can only be seen when the light from the main character hits them or the sky lights up revealing their outline. When the main character collides with any of these creatures they light up random colors and continue on their path.

**Note:** The story of this game was never fully realized as a majority of the game jam was spent on development hurdles (incomplete Facade.js plugins).

Built with the [Facade.js](http://facadejs.com/) library and available [plugins](http://plugins.facadejs.com/). Plugins used added Box2D collision and controller support.
