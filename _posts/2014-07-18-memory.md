description: In an effort not to focus too much energy in one technology I decided to build a game, albeit a simple one, in something other than canvas. I built a web based, mobile friendly version of the classic game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)">Concentration</a> using HTML, JavaScript and CSS3.
keywords: game javascript html css mobile
year: 2014

The goals I set for myself while building this game were simple: keep the code base small and straight forward. To do this I utilized jQuery to dynamically build out DOM nodes, CSS3 3D transforms for animating each tile, and a manifest file to allow for offline access.
